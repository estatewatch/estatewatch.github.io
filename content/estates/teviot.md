535 homes have been earmarked for demolition by housing association Poplar HARCA at its Teviot estate in Tower Hamlets.

The estate underwent a stock transfer to [Poplar HARCA housing association](https://www.poplarharca.co.uk/), which was [completed](http://democracy.towerhamlets.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=10064) in 2007.

The estate borders the Limehouse Cut canal to the North, the River Lea to the East and Langdon Park and Balfron Tower to the South. Poplar HARCA have already come under [criticism](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/19/balfron-20-how-goldfingers-utopian-tower-became-luxury-flats) for its privatisation of Balfron Tower.

The scheme is part of Poplar HARCA's [‘Poplar Reshaping’ masterplan](https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/download?ac=1222139) which envisages the redevelopment of ten estates: Aberfeldy, Brownfield, Bow Bridge, Coventry Cross, Burdett, Devons, Lansbury, Leopold, Lincoln and Teviot.

In December 2018, residents were [told](images/teviotDec2018.pdf) they would be balloted on the regeneration options for their estate, but that if they chose refurbishment then they would have to have new homes built above them in order to pay for the refurbishment.

In March 2019, residents were [informed](images/teviotMarch2019.pdf) that their steering group had requested the refurbishment option to be taken off the table.

Unsurprisingly, the majority of residents [voted for full redevelopment](https://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/politics/teviot-housing-estate-regeneration-voted-1-6052355) in May 2019.

Residents were also told that the scheme would take 7 to 10 years to complete but in tender documents [reported in the Housing Today journal](https://www.housingtoday.co.uk/news/1bn-teviot-estate-regen-goes-out-to-tender/5104462.article), Poplar HARCA cites a contract term of between 15 and 20 years:

It is noteworthy that Poplar HARCA's [rehousing offer](images/teviotoffer.pdf) to leaseholders is more generous than most (with the exception of Circle Housing's [offer in Merton](images/mertonoffer.pdf) as it allows a certain amount of the shared equity loan to be written off after 7 years (Circle writes it off completely).

A planning application was lodged in June 2024, for demolition of the estate and construction of 1928 new homes of which 411 social or living rent, 98 intermediate affordable and 1419 private homes.

The planning application says that the 411 replacement social will be provided either as social rent or THLR (Tower Hamlets Living Rent) which is around three times more expensive than social rent.

This is breach of the Mayor's own policy which says that social rented homes must be replaced with like-for-like tenure. The Mayor's [stage 1 report](https://development.towerhamlets.gov.uk/online-applications/files/844BA29DA92775EF861EA51FC8D34223/pdf/PA_24_00922_A1-GLA_STAGE_1_REPORT-2102510.pdf) for the planning application brushes over this and is silent on the fact that the 35% affordable housing proposed falls short of his 50% minimum policy requirement for estate regenerations.

The scheme's failure to provide the minimum 50% affordable housing requirement is justified by a an [FVA](src/images/teviotfva.pdf) (Financial Viability Appraisal) submitted by Poplar HARCA. 

The appraisal argues that providing more than 35% affordable housing would make the scheme 'unviable' but brushes over the fact that a 16% protected profit margin for Poplar HARCA has been written in to the appraisal as a cost - i.e. Poplar HARCA is guaranteed a £131m profit before any surplus available for affordable housing is calculated.



The appraisal also counts on £95m grant funding from the Mayor despite the Mayor's policy of funding only *additional* social housing on estate redevelopments and not *replacement* social housing!

This begs the question of what is the point in the Mayor's estate regeneration policies if he allows boroughs, developers and housing associations to routinely ignore them?
