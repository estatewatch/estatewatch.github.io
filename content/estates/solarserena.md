Circa 100 homes are under threat of demolition on Havering's Parkhill and Sunrise estate in Hornchurch.

Solar, Serena and Sunrise Courts have been earmarked for redevelopment as part of Havering's [Â£1bn joint venture with developer Wates Residential](https://www.wates.co.uk/articles/case-study/borough-of-havering-housing-redevelopment/) which will see 12 of the borough's estates redeveloped.

The scheme is being [funded](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/housing-and-land/homes-londoners/estate-regeneration/estate-regeneration-data) by the Mayor and has been exempted from his [requirement](/approved/ballotexemptions) to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.
