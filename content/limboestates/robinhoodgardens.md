The remaining half of the Robin Hood Gardens estate in Poplar is earmarked for demolition.

The scheme forms part of a five-phase regeneration project, aiming to create a total of 1,575 new homes, 566 social rent and 132 intermediate. 

The [planning application](https://development.towerhamlets.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=DCAPR_101615) was approved in 2012.

The first phase where the western block was demolished was completed in 2015.

The eastern block has been emptied and is due to be demolished as part of the next phase of the scheme. As of July 2024, it was [reported](https://poplarlondon.co.uk/streets-sky-utopian-social-housing-robin-hood-gardens-balfron-tower/) to be still standing.
