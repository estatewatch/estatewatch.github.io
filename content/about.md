# About Us

<div class="message-box">
Supported by <a href="https://justspace.org.uk"> Just Space</a> and <a href="https://londontenants.org">London Tenants Federation</a>, we provide help and guidance to residents living on estates earmarked for demolition.
</div>

The project was initially kickstarted in 2020 by <a href="https://justspace.org.uk/"><u> Just Space</u></a> and <a href="https://londontenants.org/">The London Tenants Federation</a> working together with the University of Leicester and King’s College London on a research project that has provided detailed evidence since 1997 of the displacement of London council tenants and leaseholders through regeneration schemes.

As the research project drew to a close, this website was developed as a resource for communities on estates facing regeneration, to know their rights and to ensure that tenants and residents’ choices will be respected. We want to monitor each scheme as it progresses and make space for residents to add updated information about their estate in real time. This can be a precious tool to hold Councils across London and the Mayor to account and make sure that future regeneration schemes benefit existing local communities.
