{%- css %}{% include "public/css/message-box.css" %}{% endcss %}
<div class="message-box">
The Estate Watch website uses<a href="https://pages.github.com/"> Github</a> (a web-based platform which facilitates collaborative development of software projects) to store and publish data. The first step to getting involved is to sign up for a (free) github account at <a href="https://github.com/signup"> https://github.com/signup</a>.
</div>

Once you are signed up and logged in to Github you will be able to click on any of the _'edit this page'_ links on the Estate Watch website such as the one below:

The first time you click on the link, you will be asked if you want to 'fork' the repository.

Click the green 'fork this repository' button and you will then be taken to the page you want to edit. 

> **Note:** You will only have to fork the repository once - the first time you make an edit.

Once you have been redirected to the source text page, you will see a page shown in the screenshot below. You will need to click on the pencil icon at the top right of the page to enter editing mode:

Once in editing mode, you can add or amend the page accordingly. You can edit the text directly or add images using the add image icon at the bottom.

This text editor differs from most word processing environments in that it uses 'Markdown' - a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. You can read a brief guide on using Markdown here: <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax>

When you have finished editing, click on the green 'Commit Changes' button on the top right corner of the page. This will submit your proposed changes for review by a moderator before being published.
