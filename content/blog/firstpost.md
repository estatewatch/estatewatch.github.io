The website was mothballed last year when funding ran out but has now been spruced up, updated and put back online as an open source project.

The new website now has a [live CSV open data feed](/estates.csv) and the ability to be collaboratively edited and managed directly through a web browser. Info on how to get involved or contribute can be found [here](/guide). 

As part of the re-fresh we identifed a number of new estates to add to the list of those under threat, these are:
* The [Airways estate](/estates/airways/) (Ealing)
* The [Savona estate](/estates/savonaestate/) (Wandsworth)
* The [Chiswick Road estate](/estates/chiswickroad/) (Enfield)
* The [Clockhouse estate](/estates/clockhouse/) (Sutton)
* The [Copley Close estate](/estates/copleyclose/) (Ealing)
* The [Devons Road estate](/estates/devonsroad/) (Tower Hamlets)
* The [Grange Court estate](/estates/grangecourt/) (Ealing)
* The [Ibscott Close estate](/estates/ibscottclose/) (Barking & Dagenham)
* The [Islip Manor estate](/estates/islipmanor/) (Ealing)
* The [Lambourne Close estate](/estates/lambourneclose/) (Ealing)
* The [Main Avenue estate](/estates/mainavenue/) (Enfield)
* The [Medlar Farm estate](/estates/medlarfarm/) (Ealing)
* The [Regina Road estate](/estates/reginaroad/) (Croydon)
* The [Saltford Close estate](/estates/saltfordclose/) (Bexley)
* The [Sheephouse Way estate](/estates/sheephouseway/) (Kingston)
* The [Shipton Close estate](/estates/shiptonclose/) (Barking & Dagenham)
* The [Shires estate](/estates/shires/) (Enfield)
* The [South Lane estate](/estates/southlane/) (Kingston)
* The [Toplocks estate](/estates/toplocks/) (Ealing)
* The [Trinity Way estate](/estates/trinityway/) (Ealing)
* The [Wessex Close estate](/estates/wessexclose/) (Kingston)
* The [Yeading Lane(1) estate](/estates/yeadinglane/) (Ealing)
* The [Yeading Lane(2) estate](/estates/yeadinglane2/) (Ealing)

In addition, we have added a number of social housing blocks earmarked for demolition but which are not technically 'estates'. 

These include [Brook House](/estates/brookhouse/)(Ealing), [Dean Court](/estates/deancourt/)(Ealing), [Eros House](/estates/eroshouse/)(Lewisham), [Neville Close](/estates/nevilleclose/)(Ealing), [Oaktree Court](/estates/oaktreecourt/)(Ealing), [RAF Uxbridge](/estates/rafuxbridge/)(Hillingdon), [Southwold Drive](/estates/southwolddrive/)(Barking & Dagenham), [Walbrook House](/estates/walbrook/)(Enfield), [Morden Regeneration Zone](/estates/mordenregenerationzone/) (Merton) and [Mendip and Penine House](/estates/mendippenine/) above Edmonton Green Shopping Centre. 

In future blog updates, we will be looking at what exactly constitutes a housing estate for the purposes of the Mayor's [Estate Regeneration Policies](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/housing-and-land/homes-londoners/estate-regeneration) and how these should be applied.

Most of the additions are from scouring through London boroughs' new draft Local Plans and site allocation documents where estates have been identified as potential redevelopment sites. We will also be taking a closer look at the Local Plan process of site allocations and the 'call for sites' which informs them as well as the implications this has for any subsequent meaningful consultation with residents.
